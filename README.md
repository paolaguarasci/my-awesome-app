### Building

Using this the workflow above, GitHub will build your app every time you push a commit.


### Releasing

When you want to create a new release, follow these steps:

- Update the version in your project's package.json file (e.g. 1.2.3)
- Commit that change (git commit -am v1.2.3)
- Tag your commit (git tag v1.2.3). Make sure your tag name's format is v*.*.*. Your workflow will use this tag to detect when to create a release 
- Push your changes to GitHub (git push && git push --tags)

After building successfully, the action will publish your release artifacts. By default, a new release draft will be created on GitHub with download links for your app. If you want to change this behavior, have a look at the electron-builder docs.
